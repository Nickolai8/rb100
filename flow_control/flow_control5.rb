# The reason we got that input, was that in the function/method 
# "equal_to four", there is only one "end", but we need two, given that
# both a function definition and an if/else statement require an end 
# statement. To correct it, we could put another end, anywhere between
# the end of line 5 and the start of line 8 (although preferrably on 
# its own line)
